The (Proper) Catholic Response to InequalityThe Three Main Sub-themes1.	Pope Francis on Inequality2.	Sources of Inequality3.	Catholic Initiatives to Combat Inequality (Primarily initiatives in New York City)At first glance, this three-fold interactive project may seem much too ambitious, especially for someone who struggles with rudimentary code. The Three Questions to Determine its Viability:1.	Is it on topic? Yes, the class theme for the semester is inequality and no other public figure has made this more of an issue than Pope Francis. Bernie Sanders is commanding the headlines now, but as a presidential candidate he’s geared towards an American audience. Pope Francis’s mission is more broad as he must address not only inequality in the United States and how it affects American citizens, but its broader implications for everyone else.2.	Is this too broad?Not in how I want to tell it. Pope Francis is key because he has a deep understanding of what inequality is. It’s not simply one person earning more than another or that one student has received more financial support compared to another. His notion is rooted in the Gospel message, which proclaims that each person: wealthy or poor, woman or man, innocent or guilty, native-born or foreigner, etc. has an inherent dignity. The worst form of inequality is when a person is deprived of this dignity. New York City, especially given Pope Francis’ recent visit, is a proving ground to see how well this understanding of the human person is put into action.3.	Enough talk, where are the stories?The roots of inequality are complex and can destructively entangle relationships, institutions and people. I want to feature people and organizations that are attempting to cut away at the roots.Story Idea #1: Women Prisoners and their Transition Back into Society	Source of Inequality: Prejudice against incarcerated women.	Effect of Inequality: Without support, increased recidivism that carries on 			       to the next generation.Catholic Response: Sr. Tesa Fitzgerald and Hour Children http://hourchildren.org 	Last semester I did a video project on Sr. Tesa Fitzgerald and her work with formerly incarcerated mothers. Fitzgerald believes that there is a stigma attached to those who have been imprisoned. She wants to respond with love by providing formerly incarcerated women and their children with homes. Interactive Element: Tracing Hour Children’s workflow i.e. the prisons that they visit, how many women prisoners are in New York State, a percentage breakdown of the types of crimes that they’ve committed, an interactive map of the locations of Hour Children’s transitional housing facilities and the services they offer as well as photographs and testimonials of “success stories.”	Story Idea #2: Support Network in New York City for Refugees and Migrants		Source of Inequality: Belief that those who are in this country 	
		without proper immigration status or are not thoroughly naturalized do 
		not belong here. Catholic Response: Last year, Pope Francis called on 		all European parishes to take in one refugee family in an attempt to 
		alleviate the crisis. The Migrant Center in Manhattan is an 
		organization that seeks to provide support 
		http://www.stfrancisnyc.org/migrantcenter/ 		
		Interactive Elements: Infographics of the migrants’ home countries and 		the services provided at the center. I still have more research to do. 		If possible I would like to feature a Syrian family sponsored by 			either the Migrant Center or the Archdiocese of New York.Other people and organizations to feature for the remaining three stories: Sr. Pauline Quinn, founder of the first prisoner program to train service dogs. 	Bridges and Pathways of Hope and Courage: 		http://www.bpofcourage.org/about-us.html Prison Pet Partnership Programhttp://prisonp.tripod.com 	More infohttp://www.thecompassnews.org/2013/03/sister-is-on-a-mission-to-help-prisoners-help-others/ Eleanor Rae, founder of the Hutchinson River Restoration Project. While she is no longer a practicing Catholic she used to work for the archdiocese and was an early advocate for protecting the environment. Her work is very much in the spirit of Pope Francis’ call to give due respect to the earth. The attempt to clean up the Hutchinson River is a story in itself. http://www.hutchinsonriverrestorationproject.org Initiatives to Help the HomelessThe Dwelling Place:	http://www.thedwellingplaceshelter.org/home.aspx Covenant House: ___Anti-Hunger:St. Francis of Assisi BreadlineAnti-Gang:	Franciscan Friars of the RenewalSupport for those with AIDS Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charity: Gift of LoveNotes:Background Info on Pope Francis’ Position on Inequality:	Money is Not Ultimate Goodhttp://fortune.com/2015/09/20/pope-francis-income-inequality/ The Joy of the Gospel: No to an Economy of Exclusionhttps://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/apost_exhortations/documents/papa-francesco_esortazione-ap_20131124_evangelii-gaudium.html Addressing Income Inequality Before Congresshttp://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2015/09/24/pope-francis-addresses-congress.html Income Inequalityhttp://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/09/23/why-the-pope-likes-to-talk-about-inequality-and-the-u-s/ Pope Francis on Moneyhttp://fortune.com/2015/09/14/pope-francis-capitalism-inequality/ St. Lawrence Quote:2012 Budget of Archdiocese of New Yorkhttp://archny.org/documents/2014/9/2012_Financial_Report.pdf
